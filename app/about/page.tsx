      <p>
        Workers Lofi Radio is a chill stream built from public‑domain protest songs and
        global solidarity archives. We mix memory with melody — to remind ourselves that
        rest is resistance, and rhythm is collective.
      </p>
      <p>
        The project aims to create a space where workers around the world can share
        shout‑outs, learn about labor history, and relax to lofi beats. This minimal
        prototype uses free services so that anyone can spin up their own station.
